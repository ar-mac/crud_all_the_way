# CRUD all the way ðŸŒˆ

This is sandbox app used to play and learn react-query 

## Getting Started

To setup the application (one time only) run:

`yarn install`
`yarn run init:db`

To start the application run in separate terminal windows:
`yarn start` and `yarn run serv`

## Tools

Apart from [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com) we'll be using [AntDesign](https://ant.design/components/overview/) to quickly create good looking application.
